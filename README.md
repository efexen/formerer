# Formerer

Formerer provides end points to send your forms to from your static sites.

Heavily WIP!

To start Formerer:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### TODO

- [ ] More tests!
- [ ] Document usage
- [ ] Elixirify code
- [ ] Notifications & integrations (email, slack, chrome, drive etc)
